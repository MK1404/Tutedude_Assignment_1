# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
num1 = int(input('Enter the first number:'))
num2 = int(input('Enter the second number:'))

# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:

Addition = num1+num2
Subtraction = num1-num2
Multiplication = num1*num2
Division = num1/num2

# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

print('Addition is:',Addition)
print('Subtraction is:',Subtraction)
print('Multiplication is:',Multiplication)
print('Division is:',Division)

# Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

# 1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.

first_name = input('Enter your first name:')
last_name = input('Enter your last name:')

#2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.

Full_name = first_name+" "+last_name+'!'

# 3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.
